            <li>1 1/4 Cup / 310ml Boiling Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 160C / 325F</li>
            <li>In a medium sized mixing bowl add the dry ingredients, the flour, baking powder, sugar, cocoa powder and salt. Use a wooden spoon to combine the ingredients together and set to the side.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add the melted butter, milk, egg and vanilla to a small bowl. Whisk together with a fork until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and gently folding the chocolate pudding batter together until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a 9″ or 25cm round dish or a 20×30 or 9×13 dish.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine the brown sugar and cocoa powder together with a whisk.</li>
            <li>Gently sprinkle the sugar topping onto the chocolate pudding batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the boiling water over the back of a spoon over the chocolate pudding, being very careful not to burn yourself. This will stop the water disturbing the sugar topping below.</li>
            <li>Place the chocolate self saucing pudding into a 160C / 325F oven for 35-40 minutes or until bubbling at the edges. Let cool for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
